# Pokedex App

 Welcome to my Pokedex website! This website showcases the projects and skills I have learned while
 progressing through CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course!

## API
This app uses the pokemon API hosted at: https://pokeapi.co/

The only function used is GET to download pokemon details.
## Pokedex
View data on over 1000 pokemon! The website loads a series of buttons that contain the pokemon
and it's number. Clicking on a button shows more details!

## Dependencies
This Website simply uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS; nothing else!
